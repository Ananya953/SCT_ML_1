# 📊 Task 01 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is developed as part of the *SkillCraft Technology Machine Learning Internship (July–August 2025)*.

The aim of the project is to create a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given the features of a house, such as its size (square feet), number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, build a model to accurately predict the price of the house using a supervised machine learning approach – *Linear Regression*.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a simple CSV file with the following columns:

| Column       | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| SquareFeet   | Size of the house in square feet   |
| Bedrooms     | Number of bedrooms in the house    |
| Bathrooms    | Number of bathrooms in the house   |
| Price        | Price of the house in INR/USD      |

*Filename:* house_data.csv

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Place the house_data.csv file in the same folder as main.py
3. Install the required libraries:
       **bash**
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
4. python main.py
